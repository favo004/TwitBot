# TwitBot
Python program designed to give a UI to a basic twitter bot. Users will be able to input twitter api credentials and customize who to target along with some basic commands

# How It Works

- Boot up the program and click add a bot
- You will need a valid twitter account. You will also need to sign up with the developer portal at https://developer.twitter.com/en to get access to Twitter's API functionality 
which we need for an operational twitter bot. You will need the API key, API key secret, Access Token, and Access Token Secret keys.
- Once you have these keys, input them into the form to create your bot
- Now that we have these in place, click on Configure Bot to apply some desired settings for your bot
- Active Targets are twitter users that your bot will watch for. We need the user id of these users which can be found at https://gettwitterid.com
- Once you have a valid twitter user to track, we go under Target Configuration and toggle the tab of the desired target
- Here we can add trigger words that the bot will look for and reply only when they appear in the target's tweets. 
- Reply phrases are what the bot will reply with if the target's tweet is deemed worthy to be replied to
- When you are satisfied, click back and now we can turn the bot on. The activity log will update the user on what the bot does.
- Now that the bot is active, you just sit back and wait for your target twitter users to tweet
